# Currency-Converter

TITLE: Currency Converter Platform

DOMAIN: Web / App

Problem Statement:

Develop a front-end for a dynamic currency converter platform that prioritizes a good user
experience. The primary objective is to create an interface that seamlessly converts various
currency units using real-time conversion rates obtained from a reliable external API. The
design should incorporate organized layouts, subtle animations, and intuitive navigation.

I used basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. I used Exchange-Rate API
for real-time currency conversion rates. 

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository into your device.
2. Open the home page.
3. Enter the amount to be converted.
4. Select the 'from' and 'to' currency.
5. Click 'Get Exchange Rates' to get the conversion.
6. Click the double arrow button to get the reverse conversion.
7. Click 'About Us' to view information about the site.
8. Click 'Contact' to enter your email and send a message.
